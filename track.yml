title: Identify root cause issues in your infrastructure
teaser: Use New Relic infrastructure to identify root cause issues in your infrastructure
description: |-
  ## Overview
  Youâ€™re the new IT engineer for Geek's Movie Shop, a site that's deployed across a distributed infrastructure. Your predecessors didn't instrument your servers, so you're in the dark with how they're behaving. However, your users are complaining, so it's time to turn on the lights.

  In this track, you use New Relic infrastructure to observe your entire infrastructure so you can identify and mitigate issues. Specifically, you use the *Host* view to see how your system is degrading. Then, you discover how the services that are running on your hosts are affecting the hosts, themselves.

  ## Objectives
  - Instrument your hosts with the New Relic infrastructure agent
  - Gather insights from your infrastructure and related services
  - Identify root cause issues in your infrastructure


  ## Requirements
  - A free [New Relic account](https://newrelic.com/signup?utm_source=developer-site)

  ## Important Note
  _This track utilizes an ephemeral virtual machine. As a result, finish the entire track in one sitting or you'll lose your progress when time expires._
